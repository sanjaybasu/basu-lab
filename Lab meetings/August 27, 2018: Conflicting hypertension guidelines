August 27, 2018: Conflicting hypertension guidelines

Simulation of Costs and Outcomes Using Different Blood Pressure Guidelines:

Over the last few years several prominent organizations have released conflicting guidelines for the screening and management of high blood pressure.  Consider the example case of a 48 year old man BP 135/87 mmHg, non smoker, normal cholesterol, no family history of heart disease, non-diabetic.  The AHA/ACC  2017 guideline calls this Stage 1 Hypertension.  The 2018 European guideline (ESC/ESH)  identifies this as high normal, the 2003 JNC-7 (NIH) guideline classification would be pre-hypertension.  JNC-8 in 2015 called this normal and for people older 60 the threshold for treatment was > SBP 150 mmHG.  USPSTF 2015 also identifies this patient as normal.  The AHA/ACC have launched an aggressive effort to expand medical intervention for people in their Stage 1 group.   In response,  the ACP and AAFP have publicly separated themselves from the AHA/ACC.  Because of these differences, clinicians and patients are confused.  The different guidelines might have substantial effects on the costs of care, the number of people treated with medication, and possibly patient outcomes.

We are considering a study that would use microsimulation methods to estimate costs, risks, and benefits for populations managed under the different guidelines.  We would create synthetic cohorts and manage them according to several different guideline. To build the models, we would reanalyze data from NHLBI trials, including AllHat,  ACCORD and SPRINT.    We would use the best evidence available from systematic reviews, and also include sensitivity analyses to consider adherence, program reach, and other variables.
